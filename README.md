Hi!ðŸ˜„

My name is Javier Cromberg and I'm a data scientist. I also have a degree in Kinesiology and Physiatry. After graduating I did my residency in Kinesiology at Hospital PiÃ±ero and later on I was Chief Resident at Hospital Nacional Alejandro Posadas. 

Thanks to my hospital formation I was able to acquire my knowledge in reading scientific papers, research and exposition in congresses or conferences.
